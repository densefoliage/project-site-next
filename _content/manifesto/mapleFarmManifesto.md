| \[a\] before wilding    | \[b\] after wilding          |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| the english countryside | the local wilds              |
| the typical look        | unexpected discoveries       |
| monocultures            | mosaics                      |
| fences that divide      | hedges that connect          |
| overgrazed pastures     | regenerating woodlands       |
| floodplains             | ephemeral wetlands           |
| life at the periphery   | life everywhere              |
| start-stop landscapes   | gradient landscapes          |
| quiet and empty         | buzzing with life            |
| green and pleasant      | overwhelming colours         |
| fragmented              | coherent                     |
| trampled flat           | verdant and textured         |
| trimmed and strimmed    | intermittently disturbed     |
| sublime beauty          | difficult beauty             |
| status quo as end goal  | status quo as starting point |
| highly managed land     | self-willed land             |
| biodiversity as index   | biodiversity as process      |
| human intervention      | multispecies collaboration   |
| valued for productivity | valued for resilience        |
| land as community asset | land as community member     |
| a place for 'doing'     | a place for 'being'          |
