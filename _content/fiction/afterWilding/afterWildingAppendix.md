### The Truth Behind the Fiction

It is important to state, loud and clear, that {{ After Wilding }} is a piece of speculative fiction based on 20 interviews I conducted with real-world rewilding practitioners. These interviews were conducted in-the-field, during site visits and volunteer planting events at {{ Maple Farm }}, a 30 acre rewilding project in Surrey, England. As such, the reflections of interviewees are highly contextual and site specific to {{ Maple Farm }}. One would imagine additional {{ After Wilding }} fictions set, for example, in the Scottish highlands or central London would present radically different social and ecological worlds.

Interview transcripts from these real-world participants have been remixed together and thematically expanded to create the three characters ({{ The Wilder }}, {{ The Landowner }}, and {{ The Volunteer }}) that are encountered in the story. The thoughts and feelings of {{ The Researcher }} are based on my personal reflections on the time I spent engaging with the rewilding activities at the real-world {{ Maple Farm }}.


### Notes on Rewilding

Rewilding and other forms of ecosystem restoration have been identified by the UN Environment Programme as key movements for delivering nature-based solutions for food insecurity, climate change, and biodiversity loss (UNEP 2021). The rewilding movement is growing in the UK, where there are close to 450 projects currently active across the country (Rewilding Britain 2021) and an increasing number of governmental and charitable funds  for the restoration of both rural and urban ecosystems (Mayor of London 2022, Natural England 2021, Rewilding Britain 2021).

However, with the UK being the 12th most nature-depleted country in the world (RSPB 2021; Sanchez-Ortiz et al. 2019), it is difficult for the UK public to imagine what a rewilded British landscape would look like. There are simply too few examples of wild nature remaining to inspire our collective imagination.

### The Why

The purpose of the {{ After Wilding }} project is to address this gap, and to present a cohesive and collaboratively-envisioned scenario of what a future British wilderness could look and feel like. It takes the hopes, fears and expectations of rewilding from today and projects them twenty years into the future so we can hold them up to scrutiny and ask whether it is a future worth pursuing.

In my perspective, {{ After Wilding }} presents an inspirational future for the British landscape, but this future is not without its problems:



* ultimately the power and responsibility to rewild land falls on private landowners,
* although government funding has increased, the government largely relies on the charity sector to organise labour for rewilding,
* while a sizable proportion of the public may have re-negotiated their relationship with nature to accommodate the wilds
