I step out of the car into the heat of the day. The sun bears down upon the exposed skin on my neck and arms as I scan my surroundings. It is like this every summer now; I should have worn sunblock. 

The last time I was here, at Maple Farm, was twenty years ago, shortly before I graduated from my master’s programme. Back then, Maple Farm was at the beginning of its rewilding journey. It was functioning as an animal sanctuary for retired horses and a small flock of sheep that had nowhere else to go. Visually, it looked like your average pastoral farm but perhaps a bit more rough around the edges where, after a year of not cutting the grass nor trimming the hedges, wild plants had already started to creep in.

As a student, I had visited Maple Farm to conduct an anthropological study on the environmental imaginaries that motivated rewilding projects. For the study, I participated in site visits and community planting events, and I interviewed members of the rewilding community that were contributing to the project. In my interviews, I asked the landowner, the project managers and volunteers about what they thought Maple Farm would be like twenty years into the rewilding process. And now, twenty years later, I am back to revisit the site, the interviewees and their visions.

I have parked the car at the top of the site, next to the old stables, haybarn and The Landowner’s house. At first glance, not much has changed up here, except that the adjacent field is now empty of horses. There were two Shetland ponies living in it last time I was here. My nostalgia is broken when a voice calls out from the direction of the haybarn.

Sitting in the shade of the open barn is the familiar face of The Wilder. She is one of the four environmentalists that started managing the rewilding project many years ago. I walk over to greet her and we spend some time catching up with each other's lives. Inside the barn is a circle of adhoc seating, a mix of sturdy wooden and monoblock chairs. Before, this space was occupied by a jumble of agricultural equipment and bales of hay. The Wilder tells me that they use the space to welcome volunteers and educational groups, mostly secondary schoolers and university students. What is left of the equipment is now stored in the stables. I ask about the whereabouts of The Landowner and I am told that she went to the dogs for a walk shortly before my arrival. In the meantime, The Wilder offers to take me on a tour of Maple Farm and, perhaps, we might bump into The Landowner on the way. I quickly grab my audio-recorder from my backpack. As we walk, I interview The Wilder about the site.
